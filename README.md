# MyGitUtils
The Git utility (util) bash scripts I write for software engineering purposes.

These scripts saves me from repeatedly and endlessly typing `git ...` on my terminal (emulator).

## Important Note

Please **be careful** when using these scripts, because they contain **batch/bulk git operations**.

**Checking `git status`** is strongly recommended before running the scripts.

## How to Start

1. Download the source or clone the repository.

2. Run the bash scripts when needed.

## Instructions on Usage

The instructions are written as echo statements and comments inside the scripts.

A fancier version of the instructions can possibly get updated later.
